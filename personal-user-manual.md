# User Manual for Jacob South
## My Style
I am very schedule-oriented, If I don't have a schedule, I tend to laze about doing nothing useful, but if I have a list, everything will be done with high efficiency
## When to Approach Me
Anytime really, however, ask me if it is a good time first, I may be in the middle of something important
## My Values
### Work
I value good work and efficiency. As long as you are able to get your work done well and without hindering the work of others, I really don't care what you do.
### Personal
I have incredibly high morals and I intend to keep it that way. Do not, under any circumstance, make any attempt to make me lower them, I will have a greatly decreased view of you if you knowingly do that, though if you did not know that about me, or sincerely apologize afterwards, everything will be fine.
That said, I also greatly respect strong stances, whether in my favor or not, as long as they are reasonable and not ridiculous.
## Preferred Communication
I like direct communictaion, whether that's in person or through text, don't make it flowery, just give me the important bits, I do not care what stacy did to make something happen, just tell me that she made it happen.
I do not care why something costs as much as it does or your reason for needing it, just tell me how much you need, and if it's a little too much we can talk about the details then.
## My Decision Making Process
I tend to over-analyze things and find it hard to come to a concrete descision. I generally will weigh the pros and cons of certain choices and choose the best one from there, however, I often cannot see various consequences untio they hit me in the face.
## How Can You Help Me?
As I said above, I cannot see some things. If you see a benefit or a serious problem with a certain choice that makes you question that choice, tell me, there's a good chance I did not see it. I also have a hard time figuring things out until I talk about it, so conversing with me about what I am doing could help me accomplish whatever task I need done.
Just talk to me. I have a really hard time initiating conversations, somebody else starting them is often a breath of fresh ari for me.
## Things I Despise
I don't like pre-concieved notions about anything, especially myself, if you have a problem with me, come to me about it.
I dislike pressure, especially when its unwarranted. If you try to pressure me into doing somthing, it will only make me less efficient. Instead, regularly remind me of the time something needs to be done. 
Above all, I hate hypocrites. If you hate me, I don't care, just don't act like you like me, there is no room for improving my own character if you try to get me to think you like me when you don't.
## A Guide to Common Misconceptions About Me
1. I don't care. - This is not true, I simply have a hard time with others' emotions. it's not that I don't care, I just don't immediately understand. If you need me to understand something, talk about it and I will know how to react.
2. Silence means I'm angry. - I am often silent simply because I don't have anything to say, if you feel like I'm avoiding you, I am not, I just don't have anything to talk about, though if you want to talk to me, I'm all ears.
3. I don't like you. - I lack some basic social skills. Sometimes I will say things in a way that makes it sound like I dislike you or am trying to offend you. That is not the case 95% of the time, I simply say things the way it makes sense in my head, if you take offense, it's generally a misunderstanding.
